## My Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles to clone immediately after installing a new OS. Execute the `full_deploy.sh` script with sudo. That will give a few basic essentials like enpass, firefox, git, slack (flatpak), VScode (flatpak), etc. It will also produce a new SSH key ready for cloning from github. Then it will install the dotfiles in the home directory, and install rust, exa, and ls.
